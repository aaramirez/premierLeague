### Inspiration

Upgrading the venerable premiersoccerstats site to take advantage of 
shiny framework and plethora of R packages to produce a much more interactive
and rich experience

  ---

### Method

Use tabs in sidebar to access tables and charts for teams/players etc.
Rows in tables and points on charts can often be clicked for drilldown info


  ---
  
### Points to Note

 * Some data has been scraped and may have to be withdrawn in time
 * Up to 2 assists are allowed per goal. This is not the official value
 but more accurately reflects players creative contributions and is
 additionally available from the beginning of the EPL
 * Data is not updated in real-time but broadly works to a weekly timetable
